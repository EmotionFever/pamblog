## Summary

[pedromar2010@gmail.com](mailto:pedromar2010@gmail.com)

I am a recent master's graduate in Computer Engineering from Instituto Superior Técnico at the University of Lisbon. However, while studying, I gained 2+ years of experience working in IT at companies such as Vodafone, where I participated in data projects.

I began working at the age of 16 as a full-stack developer at a startup company for a period of six months.

When I was 17, I created a freelance full-stack project where I implemented a fully functional desktop movie theater [![yt](imgs/youtube.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9v0_ginYi9g) and conducted interviews with the movie theater owner.

At the age of 18, I participated in a team programming contest.

At 19, I worked as a counter person for a non-profit organization and worked as coordinator for the student commission.

When I turned 20, I completed a summer internship at Vodafone, where I built their next-generation micro-services architecture that is still in use today.

At 21, I worked for over a year as a Data Scientist at a multinational American company. In this role, I served as the lead developer, designing and implementing a new deep learning recommendation system/model for the company.

Now, at 23, I am working at another multinational American company where I develop and automate multiple pipelines in Scala, resulting in an annual cost savings of 100k by eliminating manual processes.

I have a passion for technology, learning new things, and running. At 22 until the present, I joined a running team with workouts every week and completed multiple mini marathons. I am also skilled in climbing, swimming, cycling, canoeing and playing tennis.

I am currently seeking new opportunities, preferably in the field of Data or Software Engineering, where I believe I can provide the most value. However, I am also open to other opportunities.

## Testimonials

### Pavel Calado
![Director of Software Engineering at Gympass](imgs/pavel.png "Director of Software Engineering")

_Pedro is a dedicated worker and an excellent team member, not only promptly carrying out the needed tasks as also actively cooperating with the remaining team members. In addition, Pedro has shown himself resourceful and inventive. These characteristics, together with a firm dedication to his work, allowed him to implement and test all suggestions, while also taking his own decisions and defending their outcomes. At a personal level, Pedro is a communicative person, who gets along very well with all those he has worked with. From what I could observe, he is well respected by both his colleagues and his teachers._

### Kassem Hussein
![Senior Data Scientist](imgs/kassem.png "Senior Data Scientist")

_During the time I worked with Pedro he was involved in 2 projects, one for automating DAGs in a Machine learning model and another for exploring new techniques to detecting anomalies. In both projects Pedro performed with great excellence and minimal supervision._

## Experience

#### November 2022 - Present
Carpe Data leverages social media, online content, and other forms of alternative data to gain a deeper insight into the risk of insuring companies and individuals.
- Automated multiple data pipelines with over 50TB of data and over 70 steps using Airflow, which ran in parallel. This automation saved the company money, as manual queuing of each step on AWS was no longer necessary.
- Architected and implemented a scalable 10TB data pipeline orchestration system.
- Built new data pipeline steps and respective integration and unit tests in Scala to integrate new data sources into a 40TB pipeline.

    Airflow, Python, AWS EMR and Github.
